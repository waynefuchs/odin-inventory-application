TOP Inventory Application Project


## Assignment at The Odin Project

The Odin Project's [Project: Inventory Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) assignment link.

## Awesome Example Projects

It is really notable that a really solid image or two can make or break the presentation of a website. The [Athlete Arsenal](https://sport-equipment-inventory.up.railway.app/)
 site by *Ilios* is a very simple site with solid presentation. I can't get over how just a few icons, a few clean images, and a good color scheme make me want to trust the site. Even if it is a fake business. This is something I am striving to achieve on every project from here on out.
